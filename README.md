# Notes/Solutions of [Zero to Mastery Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning](https://www.learnpytorch.io/) course

The repository includes the notes and my solution of the exercises of the course. I went over this course after finishing the [Machine Learning (CS-433)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/machine-learning-cs-433/) course by EPFL to learn the implementation of DL methods with pytorch.

The repo contains:
- **Notes** - the notebooks I have written alongside with following each section of the course.
- **Exercises** - my solution of the exercises of each section.

p.s. the codes of the sections 5 and 9 are missing, as they were about modularity and deployment respectively.
